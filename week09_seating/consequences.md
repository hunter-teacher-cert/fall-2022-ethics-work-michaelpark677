Consequences of Optimizing Revenue for Airlines and their Unintended Consequences:

Cramming passengers together in rows and seats with barely enough room

Overbooking flights

Charging for everything, in-flight entertainment, meals, drinks, better seats, exit rows, and checked luggage. (I am waiting for the day when passengers have to swipe a credit card on the lavatory door to gain entry.)

Hawking airline credit cards. I actually feel sorry for the flight attendants who have to do this schlepping for the airlines. They wander up and down the aisles during the aircraft's descent like zombies hoping for signatures on applications.
