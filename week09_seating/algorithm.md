Plane Seating Algorithm (updated 11/16/2022)

Since the most desirable seats on a plane tend to be the ones towards the front of the plane,
window, and aisle seats, my algorithm would seat the premium passengers in the front first, then
seat economy passengers seated in the aft section first, then continue seating them forward.
However, I would block off a few rows of seats in the back for parents with children, groups,
passengers with special needs, nursing mothers, etc. Already, Delta Air Lines uses this method
to seat their passengers. They call it “Dynamic Seating Map,” and I agree with this method.
Also, I would reserve a few seats with extra space for passengers who may need more room
due to their bigger size.
In order to provide equity to as many passengers as possible, these accommodations need to
be made. Equity usually entails inequality because people have different needs that must be
met. There may be additional fees that may be assessed for these accommodations, but they
shouldn’t be exorbitant


I used the "reverse" function to implement my algorithm for seating the economy passengers in reverse, starting from the back of the cabin and filling the seats in reverse to ease congestion when boarding the plane.

As for providing blocked off seats for groups that include small children with parents, elderly family members, etc., the initial code has that already coded for groups of 3 to be seated in blocked off seats, although I didn't have time to figure out how to get them blocked seats towards the back of the cabin.

As for the final part of my algorithm on how to seat economy passengers who may be "bigger" than the average passenger and may have to be accommodated in a seat with more space and legroom, I will continue to work on this even after I make the submission due to the deadline, because I would really like to find a way to accomplish this task.
